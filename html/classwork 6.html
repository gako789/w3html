  Oranges are one of the most popular and widely consumed fruits in the
 world, known for their vibrant color, refreshing taste, and high 
 nutritional value. They are a rich source of vitamin C, which supports
 the immune system, helps the body heal wounds, and promotes healthy 
 skin. Oranges are also packed with antioxidants, fiber, and essential 
 minerals like potassium and calcium, making them a healthy choice for 
 boosting energy and overall wellness. They can be eaten fresh, juiced,
  or used in a variety of dishes, from salads to desserts.</p></div>

The orange tree belongs to the citrus family and thrives in warm, 
sunny climates, with major production in countries like Brazil, the
United States, and Spain. Beyond their health benefits, oranges are 
a symbol of freshness and vitality, often associated with positive
energy and joy. They are also important in global trade, contributing
to many economies through fruit exports and juice production. Whether 
enjoyed as a quick snack or a refreshing drink, oranges continue to be 
a favorite fruit for people of all ages.
